# Features

Causa RCA provides comprehensive root cause analysis capabilities for Kubernetes workloads through AI-powered automation and intelligent data collection.

---

## 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis

### Multi-Agent System

Causa uses three specialized AI agents that work together to provide accurate, actionable insights:

**1. Anomaly Detector**
- Analyzes metrics, logs, and events
- Identifies issue patterns and signatures
- Classifies anomaly types (OOM, CPU throttling, crashes, etc.)
- Fast initial triage

**2. Root Cause Analyst**
- Performs deep reasoning on collected data
- Generates detailed analysis and fix recommendations

**3. Validation Agent**
- Critiques the proposed analysis
- Validates recommendations for accuracy
- Formats output into structured JSON
- Ensures consistency and quality

## 🎯 Dual Operation Modes

### MONITORING Mode

**Proactive Continuous Monitoring**

- Scheduled scanning of labeled workloads
- Configurable scan intervals
- Label-based pod selection
- Ideal for development and testing environments
- Continuous health checks

**Configuration:**
```bash
RCA_MODE=MONITORING
RCA_SCAN_INTERVAL=5m
RCA_LABEL=kruize/rca=enabled
```

**Use Cases:**
- Development environment monitoring
- Continuous integration testing
- Baseline performance tracking
- Proactive issue detection

### ALERT_DRIVEN Mode

**Reactive Event-Based Analysis**

- Triggered by Prometheus/Alertmanager webhooks
- On-demand analysis only when needed
- Minimal resource usage when idle
- Ideal for production environments
- Integrates with existing alerting

**Configuration:**
```bash
RCA_MODE=ALERT_DRIVEN
```

**Use Cases:**
- Production incident response
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Integration with existing monitoring
- Reactive troubleshooting
