TASK
Extract the ISSUE and ASSERTIONS from the ROOT_CAUSE text.

ISSUE RULE
If the input contains:

ROOT_CAUSE: <text>

Extract ONLY the text after ROOT_CAUSE as "issueIdentified".
Do NOT rewrite, summarize, or modify the sentence.

ASSERTION RULES

Assertions must be SMALLER pieces of the ROOT_CAUSE sentence.

Important constraints:

- Assertions MUST reuse the same keywords that appear in the ROOT_CAUSE.
- Do NOT introduce new terminology.
- Do NOT invent new causes.
- Do NOT change wording significantly.

Assertions should simply break the root cause into
short verifiable statements using the SAME words.

GOOD EXAMPLE

ROOT_CAUSE:
"The container <container-name> was killed due to an out-of-memory error."

GOOD ASSERTIONS:
"Container was killed due to out-of-memory"
"Container terminated with OOM error"

BAD ASSERTIONS:
"Application crash occurred"
"System instability detected"
"Hardware failure happened"

Generate 2–3 assertions maximum.

OUTPUT FORMAT
{
  "issueIdentified": "",
  "assertions": []
}

Rules:
- assertions must be an array of strings
- assertions must reuse keywords from issueIdentified
- no nested objects
